# StreamLock Plug-in  
### Cross-Model Stability Layer for Long LLM Conversations  
© 2025 Tejas Bhone — All Rights Reserved.

StreamLock Plug-in is a proprietary LLM augmentation layer designed to give  
beginners, creators, and prompt engineers **longer, cleaner, and more stable conversations** across all major LLMs — without requiring advanced prompting knowledge.

This plug-in acts as a *stability shell* around any existing chatbot, persona, or agent.  
It prevents micro-drift, maintains role coherence, preserves user goals, and reduces the chance of sudden derailment during long sessions.

## 🔧 What StreamLock Does  
- Extends thread lifespan beyond typical drift thresholds  
- Reduces deviation from user-defined goals  
- Maintains persona alignment over long multi-turn conversations  
- Offers cross-model compatibility (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, etc.)  
- Gives consistent response patterns even for beginners  
- Works as a “stability extension” for any prompt or agent  

Designed to be **plug-and-use**, without requiring advanced system prompts.
